# Marketing Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project is a personal marketing portfolio website designed to showcase my work in social media marketing, content creation, and campaign planning. While it still needs a lot of work and more projects to be added, this is a good base for me to present several projects, explain my working process, and provide a contact form for enquiries.
