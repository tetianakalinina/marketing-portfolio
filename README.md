# Marketing Portfolio

Project Overview

This project is a personal marketing portfolio website designed to showcase my work in social media marketing, content creation, and campaign planning. While it still needs a lot of work and more projects to be added, this is a good base for me to present several projects, explain my working process, and provide a contact form for enquiries.

The focus of this project was to apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned during the course while creating a visually consistent and user-friendly website.

Live Website

https://tetianakalinina.github.io/marketing-portfolio/

Technologies Used

HTML -  structure and accessibility

CSS — my custom styling, layout, and responsiveness

JavaScript — form validation and cookie consent logic

Bootstrap 5 — grid system, basic components and icons

Custom fonts (PolySans) are self-hosted and applied using @font-face.

Features

Responsive navigation with dropdown menu

Hero section introducing the portfolio

Work section showcasing SMM, content, and campaign projects

Contact form with client-side validation

Cookie consent banner using localStorage

Custom visual styling with CSS variables and reusable components

JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used for:

Handling cookie consent (Accept / Decline) and storing the choice in localStorage

Validating the contact form using built-in HTML validation

Displaying user feedback messages after form submission

All JavaScript functionality directly corresponds to elements present in the HTML.

Design Approach

The website uses a dark theme with custom colour variables and typography. Bootstrap was used mainly for layout and structure, while most visual styles were implemented using custom CSS to allow greater design flexibility.

Notes

This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment and focuses on demonstrating understanding of front-end fundamentals rather than backend functionality. The contact form does not submit data to a server.
